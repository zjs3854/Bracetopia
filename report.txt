[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] to characterize your answer
	[ ] crashes
	[ ] infinite loops when it should not
	[ ] works only in 'print' mode
	[x] works fine
	[ ] only implemented these options: [list them below]
	[ ] other. Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

My Move algorithm does exactly as the project envisions. I make a second character array and copy everything from the first map to the second one. 
Then for every symbol in the first map if one is unhappy it will look for a new spot in the second map backwords and place it there if it is vacant in both the first in second map.


============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?
This was similar to the Gam of like homework but just had a few minor tweaks to it to make it its own thing.



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?
I leaned how to use the sleep function in c and how to take out certain things from the command line. I also leared how to use curses.h on a c file.


What was easy about this assignment?
This one was similar to the game of life. It just took time to put a different spin on the game of life. For running the program with cycles.


What gave you problems or troubles?
Checking if in the original map and the second one for the empty spaces. Also the use of curses.h was difficult to understand when initially but I got through it fairly fast.


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?
This assignment was really close to the previous one and was only just time consuming.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
I have no input for this current question. The assignment was fairly decent and I had no issues.
